# About the site

The random quote generator and blog was born out of my love for quotes and pithy statements. The goldmine of quotes can be found at https://talaikis.com/random_quotes_api/. 

Calling upon this API enables the user to get a random quote out of a collection of 75,000+ quotes from a plethora of authors!



The blog content was born out of my goodwill to spread encouraging content. I provide an accompanying summary of the content along with an explanation as to why a viewer should consume the content. I am using this as my chance to spread content that has helped me on a personal level.



Bootstrap was used. I did some CSS overrides because Bootstrap styling of certain elements takes precedence on the page. Javascript was used to perform the API call. 

# How the API call was done in JavaScript!
